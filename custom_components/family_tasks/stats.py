"""Statistics from the ledger: this week, this month, streaks.

Free of Home Assistant imports: the caller turns every booking's timestamp into
a local calendar day first, so this module only counts days.

A booking counts on the day it was booked. The card books a task when it sees
it checked off, so a task ticked in another app counts on the day the card
next shows it.
