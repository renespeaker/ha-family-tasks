A **persistent points ledger** for the
[Family Task Card](https://github.com/renespeaker/ha-family-task-card) in
[Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/). Without it, the card works out
points live from checked-off tasks — simple, but points disappear when a list is
cleared, and chores that reopen every round can't earn any. With Family Tasks,
**every point is booked and kept**, and each person gets a points sensor.

> **Status: v0.2.0 — points ledger + reward approval by push.** Use it with the
> Family Task Card v0.14.0 or newer (`points_backend: true`). Planned next:
> statistics.

## What you get

- **A points sensor per person**, e.g. `sensor.lina_points` — spendable points as
  the state, plus `earned`, `redeemed`, `reserved` and `pending` requests. Works with history graphs,
  statistics and automations.
- **Bookings that never count twice.** Every award has a unique key (the card uses
  list + task, plus the round for rotating chores). When phone and wall tablet
  both report the same task, it is booked once.
- **Services** for the card and your own automations:

  | Service | What it does |
  |---|---|
  | `family_tasks.award` | book points for a task (`key`, `person`, `points`, `task`) |
  | `family_tasks.revoke` | take an award back, e.g. when a task is unchecked (`key`) |
  | `family_tasks.redeem` | spend points on a reward; refuses if there are too few (`person`, `points`, `reward`) |
  | `family_tasks.adjust` | bonus (positive) or deduction (negative) by a parent (`person`, `points`, `reason`) |
  | `family_tasks.request_reward` | a child asks for a reward: points are reserved, parents get a push (`person`, `points`, `reward`) |
  | `family_tasks.approve` / `deny` | decide a request (`request_id`) — or tap the button in the push |

  All return the new balance (`return_response`).
- **An event** `family_tasks_points_changed` for every booking — e.g. to flash a
  light when someone earns points.
- Stored inside Home Assistant (`.storage/family_tasks`), no cloud, nothing to
  configure.

## Reward approval by push

A child asks for a reward (`family_tasks.request_reward`, or the card with
*reward approval* switched on). The points are **reserved** at once — nobody can
ask for more than is left — and the parents get a **push with "Approve" /
"Deny"** on their phones:

- **Approve** spends the reserved points, **Deny** frees them again.
- Only the first decision counts; the push then disappears from the other
  parents' phones too.
- Open requests are kept across restarts and show up in the sensor
  (`reserved`, `pending`).

**Who gets the push:** Settings → Devices & services → Family Tasks →
**Configure** → pick the notify services of the parents' phones
(`notify.mobile_app_…`, from the Home Assistant Companion app). Without a target,
requests can still be decided with `family_tasks.approve` / `deny`.

Events for your own automations: `family_tasks_reward_requested` and
`family_tasks_reward_decided` (with `approved: true/false`).

## Installation

### Via HACS (custom repository)

1. HACS → ⋮ → **Custom repositories** → add
   `https://github.com/renespeaker/ha-family-tasks`, type **Integration**.
2. Search **Family Tasks** → **Download** → restart Home Assistant.
3. **Settings → Devices & services → Add integration → Family Tasks** → Submit.
   There is nothing to fill in.

People appear with their first booking. Use the `person.*` entity as `person`
(e.g. `person.lina`) and the device is named after the person.

### Manual

Copy `custom_components/family_tasks` into your `config/custom_components/`,
restart, then add the integration as above.

## Examples

```yaml
# Bonus for helping without being asked
action: family_tasks.adjust
data:
  person: person.lina
  points: 20
  reason: Helped without being asked
```

```yaml
# Flash the kids' room light green on every booking for Lina
triggers:
  - trigger: event
    event_type: family_tasks_points_changed
    event_data:
      person: person.lina
actions:
  - action: light.turn_on
    target: { entity_id: light.kids_room }
    data: { rgb_color: [0, 255, 0], flash: short }
```
